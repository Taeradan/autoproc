= Autoproc =

Autoproc is a utility/language for email filtering.  Autoproc makes it
easy to define filtering rules.  The rules define a Haskell program,
that when executed generates a valid Procmail recipes file.  This file
can then be used with Procmail to sort and filter your email before
you see it.

You will need to have GHC or Hugs, Procmail and formail installed.

== Installation ==

At this time the only way to get a copy of Autoproc is using darcs.
To get a copy, use

  darcs get http://projects.codersbase.com/repos/autoproc

If you don't have darcs do not despair, currently Autoproc is about 5
files and can be easily downloaded by pointing your web browser at the
address just given.

== Using Autoproc ==

Edit Configuration.hs to suit your system.  Chances are the defaults
will work for you :)

Edit the file Rules.hs, it should be easy to define rules by looking
at the examples provided.  Remember that any rules which you want to
appear in your Procmail file must be in the list '''rules'''.

The next step is to compile your program.  You can use the command:
  make autoproc

To run the autoproc binary and save your rules to the file recipes use the
following command:

  $ autoproc > recipes

If you are familiar with Procmail you may want to examine the file to
see that everything was generated correctly.  Once you are confident
that you would like to use this file, you can simply move it to
$HOME/.procmailrc Depending on your system you may need to do
additional configuration to get Procmail itself running.  Usually this
is done with a .forward file, or on some systems having a .procmailrc
is enough.
